    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>The purpose of the Riverside Rafting website is to expand other ways in which our valued customers can 
      make shopping online without having to come to shop physically. This is will be another way in which will
      help the business to build revenue as customers will be able to purchase their rafting equipment and 
      safety gear entirely online and have them delivered to their desired location. We will also share other 
      relevant information such as upcoming events for everyone who might be interested and this will help 
      improve traffic to the business website. We will also share more information on the latest innovation of 
      new rafting equipment available on the website. We will also allow customers to share some of the 
      information found on the website to their personal social media sites and this will help build a 
      relationship and trust with both our local and remote customers across all states. This will also work 
      as a good marketing strategy for the business.</p>

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>The target audience could be anyone who loves white water rafting adventures, whether young or old, 
      whether employed or unemployed. As the website will be showing all of the rafting equipment such as 
      different types of inflatable rafting boats, as well as safety gear such as life jackets, helmets, 
      carbon paddles, wetsuits, drysuits, rescue throw bags, etc, all this equipment will be used for the 
      safety of the rafters. Sometimes customers will hardly find time to visit the store physically to buy 
      the types of equipment they need, sometimes could be due to locations that are far away from the store, 
      and this is where the website comes to the rescue. Customers will easily log in to the website to make 
      their purchases and have them safely delivered to the desired location. Local customers are promised to 
      have their products delivered within 24 hours guaranteed. Our Customers will be able to access the 
      website using different types of electronic devices such as desktops, laptops, smartphones, tablets, 
      iPad, etc. The website supports almost all of the currently existing web browsers such as Google Chrom, 
      Safari, Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Internet Explorer, etc.
